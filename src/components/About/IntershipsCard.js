            During my academic journey at ISET Sfax (Bachelorâ€™s degree), 
            I completed three mandatory internships. These experiences aimed to help me gain practical knowledge,
             integrate into the professional environment, and build valuable external relationships. Each internship 
            allowed me to apply my academic learning in real-world scenarios and develop essential professional skills
